# Motivation
This Repository contains Python scripts and resulting datasets used in my paper for Scintific Writing Course at TU Wien in Witersemester 2023/24.
In my paper, I aim to evaluate the capabilities of OpenAIâ€™s API in conducting experiments similar to those presented by Camburu et al. in paper [e-SNLI: Natural Language Inference with
Natural Language Explanations](https://github.com/OanaMariaCamburu/e-SNLI).
We will focus on how effectively the API can generate labels and explanations, as well as perform both tasks simultaneously, using selected sentence pairs from
the e-SNLI dataset. My analysis will be constrained to a subset of examples due to the rate limits
imposed by the OpenAI API, offering a focused investigation into its NLI performance.
